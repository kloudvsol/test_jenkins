# Here's an example Jenkins Pipeline script using Groovy. This script demonstrates how to clone a Git repository and run shell commands:

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Clone Git Repository') {
            steps {
                git url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git', branch: 'main'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Shell Commands') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh '''
                    echo "Running shell commands..."
                    ls -la
                    echo "Shell commands executed successfully!"
                    '''
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


# Explanation:
#Agent any: The pipeline can run on any available agent.

#Stage: Clone Git Repository: This uses the git step to clone the specified repository and branch.

#Stage: Run Shell Commands: The sh block runs multiple shell commands (e.g., listing files, or echoing a message).

#Replace the Git URL (https://github.com/your-repo.git) and branch (main) with your repository details.
